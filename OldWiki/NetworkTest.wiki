NetworkTest is a simple networked chat test application using reliable packets. When a client sends a message by typing it on the console, it is broadcast by the server to all connected clients. Clients connect via UDP to server's port 1234.

To start a server, use the command {{{NetworkTest server}}}

To start a client, use the command {{{NetworkTest <serveraddress> [username]}}}
