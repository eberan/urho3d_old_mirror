Tool that loads various 3D formats supported by [http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ Open Asset Import Library] and saves Urho3D model, animation, material and scene files out of them. For the list of supported formats, look [http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html here].

Usage:

{{{
AssetImporter <command> <input file> <output file> [options]

Commands:
model     Export a model and animations
scene     Export a scene and its models
dumpnodes Dump scene node structure. No output file is generated
lod       Combine several Urho3D models as LOD levels of the output model
          Syntax: lod <dist0> <mdl0> <dist1> <mdl1> ... <output file>

Options:
-b        Save scene in binary format, default format is XML
-i        Use local IDs for scene entities
-lcX      Use LOD level X for collision mesh, default is middle LOD
-lrX      Use LOD level X for raycast, default is same as visible
-loX      Use LOD level X for occlusion, default is same as visible
-na       Do not export animations
-ne       Do not create Octree & PhysicsWorld extensions to the scene
-nm       Do not export materials
-pX       Use base path X for resources in the scene file
-rX       Use scene node X as root node
-t        Generate tangents to model(s)
