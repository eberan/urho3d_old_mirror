RampGenerator creates 1D and 2D ramp textures for use in light attenuation and spotlight spot shapes.

Usage:

{{{
RampGenerator <output file> <width> <power> [dimensions]
}}}

The output is saved in PNG format. The power parameter is fed into the pow() function to determine ramp shape; higher value gives more brightness and more abrupt fade at the edge. 

The texconv tool from the DirectX SDK needs to be available through the system PATH.
