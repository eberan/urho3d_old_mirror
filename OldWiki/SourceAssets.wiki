The SourceAssets directory in Urho3D contains assets that need compilation before they can be utilized during runtime.

Currently, this means models and HLSL shaders. The OgreImporter and ShaderCompiler tools are used for the process.

[http://www.cmake.org cmake] build scripts are provided to compile the example assets; either expand those build scripts for your own assets, or create an alternative way for compiling them (such as straightforward batch files.)
