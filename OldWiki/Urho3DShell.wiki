An Urho3D example program which instantiates the Urho3D engine and either loads & runs a script file, or loads a scene. The script file should implement the function void start(), which should in turn subscribe to all necessary events, such as the application update. If a scene is loaded, it should contain script objects to implement the application logic.

There are batch files in the Bin directory which run various example scripts:

  * Avatar.bat - simple player character example
  * Editor.bat - the Urho3D scene editor
  * NSWScript.bat - a script based remake of NinjaSnowWar
  * GraphicsTest.bat - corresponds to the old Test example, remade in script
