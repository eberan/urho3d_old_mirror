A "box" that divides space recursively (along the X, Y & Z axes) into smaller boxes or octants, until a certain subdivision depth has been reached. Each octant stores a list of objects contained within for accelerated scene queries.

In Urho3D, only scene nodes with immediate rendering significance are stored in the octree. They all derive from the class VolumeNode. These include [Light lights], [GeometryNode geometry objects], and [Zone zones] which define global scene rendering parameters.

The octree has an update function, which is called by [Rendering Pipeline] each frame. During the update, all "dirtied" volume nodes (nodes that have changed transform or the size of their bounding box) are checked, if they need to be moved to a different octant. Nodes can also perform update logic before the reinsertion.

Unlike [Scene], the octree does not own the scene nodes or "keep them alive" via a shared pointer, it simply stores raw pointers to them. The nodes will notify the octree at deletion time, to ensure a deleted node will not be stored or be attempted to be updated.
