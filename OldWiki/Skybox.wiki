A [SceneNode scene node] that derives from [StaticModel], but overrides the camera position to appear to extend infinitely far away. Despite the name, can also be used to implement other kinds of sky geometry, such as a plane or a dome.

Usually needs to be rendered with a specific [Material material], for example one that disables depth write, to display correctly and to not interfere with other objects.
