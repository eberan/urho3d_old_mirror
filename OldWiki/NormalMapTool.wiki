NormalMapTool converts normal map images into DXT5 format, with an encoding that preserves quality better than simply compressing the original, unmodified image. The encoding is:

  * X axis (red in the original normal map) goes into the alpha channel
  * Y axis (green in the original normal map) goes into the color channels
  * Z axis will be reconstructed in the pixel shader

Usage:

{{{
NormalMapTool <input image file>
}}}

The texconv tool from the DirectX SDK needs to be available through the system PATH.
