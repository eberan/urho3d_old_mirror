NinjaSnowWar is a third person action game example included with Urho3D. Was originally implemented with [http://www.ogre3d.org OGRE], [http://www.ode.org ODE] & [http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/OgreODE OgreODE] in the year 2007. It demonstrates the use of [Scene entity-components] to build the audio, visual and logic aspects of a game. However, because it's a port / reimplementation from another set of libraries, the code may not in parts be fully "idiomatic" of Urho3D, and so care is advised when using it for
learning purposes.

By default, the game runs in singleplayer mode. However, a co-op multiplayer mode exists as well. See [Network].
