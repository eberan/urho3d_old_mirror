{{{
byte[4]    Identifier UANI
cstring    Animation name
float      Length in seconds
uint       Number of tracks

  For each track:
  cstring    Track name (practically same as the bone name that should be driven)
  byte       Mask of included animation data. 1 = bone positions 2 = bone rotations 4 = bone scaling
  uint       Number of keyframes

    For each keyframe:
    float      Time position in seconds
    Vector3    Position (if included in data)
    Quaternion Rotation (if included in data)
    Vector3    Scale (if included in data)
}}}

Note: animations are stored using absolute bone transformations. Therefore only lerp-blending between animations is supported; additive pose modification is not.
