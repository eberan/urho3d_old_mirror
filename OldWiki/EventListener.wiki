Class that you derive from to be able to subscribe to & receive [EventSystem events].

By default, the handleEvent() function dispatches events automatically to the proper handler function. For advanced use, you can override handleEvent().

Note that all event subscribers are stored in EventListener static member variables; therefore no separate "event manager" object is required, but as a consequence the event subscribers are "global" to the whole program.
