A [SceneNode scene node] with projection parameters: FOV, near/far clipping distance, and perspective or orthographic mode. The current transform of the camera combined with the projection parameters defines a viewing frustum which can be used to test which objects are visible for rendering.

Normally you use a Camera to determine how the 3D scene should be shown to the user, but internally they are also used for shadow map rendering: for each shadow-casting light, a shadow camera is created & automatically positioned.
