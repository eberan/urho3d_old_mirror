Defines collision geometry for the physics simulation through an XML file. Can refer to simple geometric shapes like boxes or spheres, or to a 3D model, which can be used either as a triangle mesh, as a convex hull, or as a height field.

The possible elements: (position and rotation attributes are optional; an identity transform is assumed if missing. LOD level attribute is also optional; the default from the model file will be used if missing.)

When a model is used as height field, it should be planar in its shape. The X & Z size attributes are the number of points in those directions; the Y axis will be used to determine the actual height at each point. If the sizes are missing, they will be guessed.
